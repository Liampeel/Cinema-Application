CINEMA BOOKING SYSTEM SOLUTION

The Cinema Booking System is a collection of programs that allows for the interaction between a Cinema and a Customer to allow for customers to book tickets to view a movie.

The system also provides:


 	A Point-Of-Sale (POS) system for use by staff on-site at the cinema to allow for ticket bookings

 	A website allowing for customers to book tickets and manage their booking online

 	A SQLite3 Server run on Flask using the REST API to allow for simple requests to be made by the above systems about movie information using a custom API.

 	Account login system to allow for customers to manage bookings securely with SHA256 hashing and salting.

 	Printable dynamic tickets for customer's use both in the cinema and at home.


The Cinema Booking System was created by Alexander Hoare, Callum Perkins, Joshua Steele-Gomes, Katie Mitchell, Liam Peel and Kieron Hushon.
